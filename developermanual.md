Developer manual for final project

The Weather Intelligence Platform is a responsive web application that allows users to view 7-day weather forecasts for any location in the world using latitude and longitude. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app connects to external APIs for real-time forecast data and uses Supabase to log user searches and display recent history. The app is designed to provide clean, visual insights for travelers, planners, and weather-conscious users.

Target Browsers are, Chrome (Desktop and Android), Safari (macOS and iOS), Firefox (Desktop), and Microsoft Edge  

You will need a web browser like Chrome or Safari. You will also need Github, and Visual Studio Code. Node.js is optional.

In terms of future development, future devlopers can improve error handling. The app also doesn't utilize user authentication, which future devleopers canincorprate into the application.
