The Weather Intelligence Platform is a responsive web application that allows users to view 7-day weather forecasts for any location in the world using latitude and longitude. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app connects to external APIs for real-time forecast data and uses Supabase to log user searches and display recent history. The app is designed to provide clean, visual insights for travelers, planners, and weather-conscious users.
